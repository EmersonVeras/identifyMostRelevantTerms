# Identifying Relevant Terms in Medical Records Through Natural Language Processing 💻

This repository is comprised of several assigments from [Instituto Atlântico's Cognitive Computing Bootcamp](https://www.atlantico.com.br/academy-bootcamp/). 

Most of the coding is done using Python 3.

## Introduction 🔍

This project provides automated identification of relevant terms in medical records by use of classical NLP algorithms.

Input texts are written in Portuguese.

### How to run this project

1. Create a virtual environment:

`python3 -m venv env`

2. Activate it:

`source env/bin/activate`

3. Install the dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Install additional packages, if needed

> Nltk and stanza libraries have additional packages that have to be downloaded

`python3 src/nlp/utils/downloads.py`

5. Run the application entry point:

`python3 main.py`
